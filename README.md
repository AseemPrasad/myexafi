🚀 Vision

A proactive, AI-powered finance assistant that doesn’t just track your spending, but coaches you toward smarter financial decisions — like having a mini-CFO in your pocket.

🧠 Enhanced Core Features

Feature	Description

🔍 Auto Insights Layer	Beyond categorizing, it detects hidden spending patterns: “You spend more on weekends when it rains — want to set a cap for rainy days?”
🧠 Financial Health Score	Combines spending habits, debt levels, savings rate, and financial goals into a dynamic score (like a credit score, but for financial discipline).
💬 AI Coach Personas	Choose your coach: Tough Accountant, Chill Friend, or Data Nerd — each gives feedback in a tone/style that fits your personality.
🎯 Goal-Based Micro-Plans	“Want to save ₹50,000 for a Goa trip in 5 months? Here's your weekly plan — and how to stay on track.”
📉 Debt Optimization Advisor	“Pay your credit card before the 17th to avoid ₹500 in interest. Want to automate it?”
🧠 Smart Saving Triggers	Detects when you can save: “Got a bonus? Want me to move ₹1,500 to savings before you spend it?”
🎮 Gamified Challenges	“Can you do a No-Spend Weekend? Save ₹200 and earn a badge!” — tied to rewards and habit-building.
📅 Life-Event Mode	Planning a wedding, moving, or starting college? AI adjusts budgeting, savings, and alerts based on big life changes.
🔐 Privacy Layer (Explainable AI)	All recommendations come with transparency.
